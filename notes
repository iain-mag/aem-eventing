Editing the Content Fragment sends events to the cloud runtime (acp/sync_event_handler_*).
Your local UI (via config.local.json) is now pointing to the cloud runtime for load-processed-aem-events.
Running the UI in the shell provides a real IMS Bearer token, so the cloud action authorizes and returns data.
